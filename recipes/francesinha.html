        <h1>Francesinha</h1>
        <img src="https://www.pingodoce.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/francesinha.jpg">
        <p>Francesinha is a Portuguese sandwich, originally from Porto, made with layers of toasted bread and assorted hot meats such as roast,<br>
             steak, wet-cured ham, linguiça, or chipolata over which sliced cheese is melted by the ladling of a near-boiling tomato-and-beer sauce called molho de francesinha.<br>
            It is typically served with french fries.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 Linguiça/pp
                Cured traditional Portuguese pork sausage with a distinct orange look due to the usage of paprika.<br>
                Aka “Portuguese Sausage” in the New England area and Hawai. 
                Also can be found in Brazilian stores/butchers.</li>
            <li>1 Sausage/pp (salsicha fresca)<br>
                Uncured traditional Portuguese pork sausage. Closest equivalent would be Italian sausage.</li>

            <li>2 slices/pp Baloney (sliced thin)</li>
            <li>1 steak/pp Rump steak (cut thin)</li>

                Typical Portuguese semi-soft, cow-milk cheese. Aka “Flemish Cheese”.<br>
                If this cannot be found, the alternative should be a bland, neutral-type of cow-milk cheese.<br>
                Provolone could be an option.</li>
            <li>1 Egg/pp (optional)</li>
            <li>130 g/pp Fries (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to make a Francesinha ?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slightly toast the bread – in the oven or in the toaster but without smooshing it, so it doesn’t lose its thickness</li>
            <li>Cook the steak medium/rare and allow it to rest away from the heat for a few minutes, to retain the juices. Slit it slightly so that it’s easier to cut later on.</li>
            <li>Cut the linguiça and the Italian sausage length wise and trim them, if necessary, to match the size of the bread. Cook them in the same pan as the steak.</li>
            <li>Fry the egg(s) in the same pan again (optional). Fry the potatoes on the side (opcional).</li>
            <li>Assembling: after toasted, place one slice of bread in a deep dish that can go in the oven,<br>
                and lay the slices of ham and baloney over the bread; place the sausage and the linguiça interspersed,<br>
                side by side, and then the steak; place the second slice of bread on top and cover it all with cheese slices.</li>
            <li>Turn on the broil and place it in the oven until the cheese has melted.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, (place the egg on top), pour at least two ladles of sauce over the francesinha and serve immediatly.</li>
            <li>Pour the rest of the sauce in a gravy boat and serve seperately (as well as the fries).</li>
        </ol>
